/**
 * SECTION:comac-device
 * @Title: comac_device_t
 * @Short_Description: interface to underlying rendering system
 * @See_Also: #comac_surface_t
 *
 * Devices are the abstraction Comac employs for the rendering system
 * used by a #comac_surface_t. You can get the device of a surface using
 * comac_surface_get_device().
 *
 * Devices are created using custom functions specific to the rendering
 * system you want to use. See the documentation for the surface types
 * for those functions.
 *
 * An important function that devices fulfill is sharing access to the
 * rendering system between Comac and your application. If you want to
 * access a device directly that you used to draw to with Comac, you must
 * first call comac_device_flush() to ensure that Comac finishes all
 * operations on the device and resets it to a clean state.
 *
 * Comac also provides the functions comac_device_acquire() and
 * comac_device_release() to synchronize access to the rendering system
 * in a multithreaded environment. This is done internally, but can also
 * be used by applications.
 *
 * Putting this all together, a function that works with devices should
 * look something like this:
 * <informalexample><programlisting>
 * void
 * my_device_modifying_function (comac_device_t *device)
 * {
 *   comac_status_t status;
 *
 *   // Ensure the device is properly reset
 *   comac_device_flush (device);
 *   // Try to acquire the device
 *   status = comac_device_acquire (device);
 *   if (status != COMAC_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *     printf ("Failed to acquire the device: %s\n", comac_status_to_string (status));
 *     return;
 *   }
 *
 *   // Do the custom operations on the device here.
 *   // But do not call any Comac functions that might acquire devices.
 *   
 *   // Release the device when done.
 *   comac_device_release (device);
 * }
 * </programlisting></informalexample>
 *
 * <note><para>Please refer to the documentation of each backend for
 * additional usage requirements, guarantees provided, and
 * interactions with existing surface API of the device functions for
 * surfaces of that type.
 * </para></note>

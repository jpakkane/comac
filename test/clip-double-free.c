 * _comac_clip_intersect_boxes() is called with clip->num_boxes != 0. It then
 * calls _comac_boxes_init_for_array (&clip_boxes, clip->boxes, clip->num_boxes)
 * and free (clip->boxes), stealing the clip's boxes, but leaving a dangling
 * pointer behind.
 * Because this code already intersected the existing boxes and the new ones, we
 * now have num_boxes == 0. This means that _comac_clip_set_all_clipped() gets
 * called and tries to free the clip's boxes again.

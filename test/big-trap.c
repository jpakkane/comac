#include "comac-test.h"

/* This test was originally written to exercise a bug in pixman in
 * which it would scribble all over memory when given a particular
 * (and bogus) trapezoid. However, a recent change to
 * _comac_fixed_from_double changed the details of the bogus trapezoid
 * (it overflows in a different way now), so the bug is being masked.
 *
 * According to Vladimir, (https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/comac/2006-November/008482.html):
 *
 *	Before the change, the two trapezoids that were generated were:
 *
 *	Trap[0]: T: 0x80000000 B: 0x80000003
 *	   L: [(0x000a0000, 0x80000000) (0x00080000, 0x00080000)]
 *	   R: [(0x01360000, 0x80000000) (0x01380000, 0x00080000)]
 *	Trap[1]: T: 0x80000003 B: 0x00080000
 *	   L: [(0x000a0000, 0x80000000) (0x00080000, 0x00080000)]
 *	   R: [(0x01360000, 0x80000000) (0x01380000, 0x00080000)]
 *
 *	After the change, the L/R coordinates are identical for both traps, but
 *	the top and bottom change:
 *
 *	Trap[0]: t: 0x80000000 b: 0xfda80003
 *	   l: [(0x000a0000, 0x80000000) (0x00080000, 0x00080000)]
 *	   r: [(0x01360000, 0x80000000) (0x01380000, 0x00080000)]
 *	Trap[1]: t: 0xfda80003 b: 0x00080000
 *	   l: [(0x000a0000, 0x80000000) (0x00080000, 0x00080000)]
 *	   r: [(0x01360000, 0x80000000) (0x01380000, 0x00080000)]
 *
 * I think the fix we want here is to rewrite this test to call
 * directly into pixman with the trapezoid of interest, (which will
 * require adding a new way to configure comac for "testing" which
 * will prevent the hiding of internal library symbols.

/* Bug history
 *
 * 2004-11-04 Ned Konz <ned@squeakland.org>
 *
 *   Reported bug on mailing list:
 *
 *	From: Ned Konz <ned@squeakland.org>
 *	To: comac@comacgraphics.org
 *	Date: Thu, 4 Nov 2004 09:49:38 -0800
 *	Subject: [comac] getting assertions [comac_cache.c:143: _entry_destroy:
 *	        Assertion `cache->used_memory > entry->memory' failed]
 *
 *	The attached program dies on me with the assert
 *
 *	$ ./testComac
 *	testComac: comac_cache.c:143: _entry_destroy: Assertion `cache->used_memory > entry->memory' failed.
 *
 * 2004-11-04 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   I trimmed down Ned's example to the following test while still
 *   maintaining the assertion.
 *
 *   Oh, actually, it looks like I may have triggered something
 *   slightly different:
 *
 *	text_cache_crash: comac_cache.c:422: _comac_cache_lookup: Assertion `cache->max_memory >= (cache->used_memory + new_entry->memory)' failed.
 *
 *   I'll have to go back and try the original test after I fix this.
 *
 * 2004-11-13 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   Found the bug. comac_gstate_select_font was noticing when the
 *   same font was selected twice in a row and was erroneously failing
 *   to free the old reference. Committed a fix and verified it also
 *   fixed the original test case.

/* Bug history

 * 2006-12-05  M Joonas Pihlaja <jpihlaja@cc.helsinki.fi>
 *
 *   There's currently a regression bug in the tessellation code from
 *   switching to the "new tessellator".  The bug is caused by
 *   confusion in the comparator used to order events when there are
 *   degenerate edges.

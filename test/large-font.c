/* Bug history:
 *
 * 2008-05-23: Caolan McNamara noticed a bug in OpenOffice.org where,
 *             when using a very large font, space would be left for a
 *	       glyph but it would actually be rendered in the wrong
 *	       place. He wrote a minimal test case and posted the bug
 *	       here:
 *
 *			corrupt glyph positions with large font
 *			https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448104
 *
 * 2008-05-23: Carl Worth wrote this test for the comac test suite to
 *             exercise the bug.

/* History:
 *
 * 2006-06-13 Paul Giblock reports a "Strange alpha channel problem" on
 * the comac mailing list.
 *
 * 2006-06-13 Carl Worth writes this test in an attempt to reproduce
 * the problem. The test first fills in a 3x3 rectangle with red, then
 * starts pounding on that center pixel with various forms of
 * zero-alpha rendering to see if its value can ever be made to
 * change.
 *
 * 2006-06-13 Paul Giblock reports that this only happens with the
 * xlib backend, and then only on some systems.

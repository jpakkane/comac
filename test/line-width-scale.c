#include "comac-test.h"

/* This test exercises the various interactions between
 * comac_set_line_width and comac_scale. Specifically it shows how
 * separate transformations can affect the pen for stroking compared
 * to the path itself.
 *
 * This was inspired by an image by Maxim Shemanarev demonstrating the
 * flexible-pipeline nature of his Antigrain Geometry project:
 *
 *	http://antigrain.com/tips/line_alignment/conv_order.gif
 *
 * It also uncovered some behavior in comac that I found surprising.
 * Namely, comac_set_line_width was not transforming the width
 * according the the current CTM, but instead delaying that
 * transformation until the time of comac_stroke.
 *
 * This delayed behavior was released in comac 1.0 so we're going to
 * document this as the way comac_set_line_width works rather than
 * considering this a bug.
